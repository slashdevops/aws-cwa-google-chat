- [AWS Single Sign-On](https://aws.amazon.com/es/single-sign-on/)
- [Workspace Admin SDK -> Directory API](https://developers.google.com/admin-sdk/directory)

- [OpenSSF Best Practices Badge Program](https://bestpractices.coreinfrastructure.org/en)
- [CodeQL documentation](https://codeql.github.com/docs/)

### Mocks

These are generated using [gomock](https://github.com/golang/mock) project.

For better integration I use [go:generate](https://pkg.go.dev/cmd/go/internal/generate) to run `gomock` command inside files when mocks are needed

### Practices

- [Accept interfaces, return structs](https://bryanftan.medium.com/accept-interfaces-return-structs-in-go-d4cab29a301b)
- [CodeReviewComments#interfaces](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/CodeReviewComments#interfaces)

## How to run the test suite

Prerequisites:

- [make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) >= 3
- [Go](https://go.dev/learn/) >= 1.17

```bash
make test
```

Clean up the test output:

```bash
make clean
```

## Acceptance policy

These things will make a PR more likely to be accepted:

- a well-described requirement
- tests for new code
- tests for old code!
- new code and tests follow the conventions in old code and tests
- a good commit message (see below)
- all code must abide [Go Code Review Comments](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/CodeReviewComments)
- names should abide [What's in a name](https://talks.golang.org/2014/names.slide#1)
- code must build on both Linux and Darwin, via plain `go build` or using `make build-dist`
- code should have appropriate test coverage and tests should be written to work with `go test ./...` or `make test`
